# Mystical Innawoods

This started as a way to add a spell research system to Innawoods, inspired by Solerante's CDDA-Magiclysm-Research-Mod: https://github.com/solerante/CDDA-Magiclysm-Research-Mod , but is gradually evolving into a full fantasy overhaul.  It's not D&D-style fantasy, though--there are no goblins and ogres and owlbears here.  It's more of a sword and sorcery setting, with spirits in the forest, devolved human monsters underground, and villages of hawkmen and lizardmen hidden in the wilds.

Research magic and become a mighty sorcerer!  Research follows four paths:
1) Herbalism: produce tinctures, potions, and magical fruits.  Create enchanted inks to allow your studies of magic to progress.
2) Enchanting: enspell magical items, producing enchanted weapons, armor, or tools.
3) Infusion: directly empower your own body with magic, causing temporary or permanent changes.  Provides sword-and-sorcery-appropriate mutation paths for Innawood!
4) Spellcrafting: Learn spells, gaining the magic of the earth, forest, moon, sea, and sky.

Also adds new locations, items, materials, monsters, etc.  Most non-hostile inhabitants of the forest have Stone Age technology, so the Innawoods progression is not affected.
