# Mystical Innawoods

Adds a spell research system to Innawoods, allowing a bridge between Innawoods's do-it-yourself gameplay and Magiclysm's magical prowess. Inspired by Solerante's CDDA-Magiclysm-Research-Mod: https://github.com/solerante/CDDA-Magiclysm-Research-Mod

This mod removes the spawning of most Magiclysm-specific locations.
