# Mystical Innawoods

Adds a spell research system to Innawoods, allowing a a method to discover sorcery and enchanting using Innawoods's do-it-yourself gameplay. Inspired by Solerante's CDDA-Magiclysm-Research-Mod: https://github.com/solerante/CDDA-Magiclysm-Research-Mod

While Magiclysm was a heavy inspiration, most spells are unique or heavily tweaked from the original.  They generally take much longer to cast and few of them are directly useful in combat without advance preparation.  A master sorcery can alleviate these limitations somewhat.
